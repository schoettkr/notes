* Setting up my machine
1. Use something like anarchy linux (arch installer) to get up running quickly. The steps I've written down and that always worked as well as what is in the arch wiki didn't work the last time I tried on my laptop that's why I resorted to an installer. Usually I prefer to do everything myself but I didn't succeed and had no time left so I went with anarchy-linux as an installer, that is pretty vanilla anyway. They have different options, I went with the one for 'advanced users' which gave me the most customizability (basically everything I cared for anyway was configurable through this).

** Internet connection
It is important to have an working internet connection. This is easily achieved by opening an Wi-Fi hotspot from phone (Tethering) and connecting via =wpa_supplicant -B -i {interfaceName} -c <(wpa_passphrase '{SSID}' {passphrase})=. The interface can be recieved via =ifconfig= or =ip link=. Full example command: =wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s0 -c <(wpa_passphrase 'Y6 Max' a1b2d3)=. However using my phone's wifi hotspot was/is incredibly slow so that wasnt/isnt really practical. It is enough to use =curl= for a small file, as needed in the following section!
*** Eduroam
Because I don't have my own internet access and have to rely on the university's internet access via eduroam - things of course have to be more complicated. Quickest solution that I found was uploading an =.tar= archive that contains the targeted =wpa_supplicant.conf= (without the passphrase/identity ofc) and the required certificate (e.g =ca.pem=) to transfer.sh (awesome service!) from another, already setup machine.

On the target device now boot the iso via usb and =curl -O https://transfer.sh/xyz/abc.tar=, extract the archive via =tar -xf abc.tar= and edit the =wpa_supplicant.conf= with e.g nano to include the passphrase/identity as well as the path to the certificate.

Then run =wpa_supplicant -i {interfaceName} -c {path/to/wpa_supplicant.conf}=, in my case that was =wpa_supplicant -i wlp3s0 -c /root/eduroam-config/wpa_supplicant.conf=. If everything goes well the connection will now be established. In my case after =CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED= showed up I knew it worked, however I didn't get back to the prompt and it stayed as is. I thought the best idea is to =ctrl-z=, but as it turns out that suspends the process and the connection will be gone. I thought that this puts the process in background :D. It would probably have been possible to detach from the process via =&= but I didnt test that because I ended up just running =wpa_supplicant= on the 1st virtual console and switching to another virtual console (tty2) via =Ctrl-Alt-F2=. Okay now we're set (=ping google.com= to verify)!

Another problem that occured was fixed by searching for the pid of =wpa_supplicant= (was running from teathering with phone )with =top= and killing it before runnig wpa_supplicant withthe configuration file. If that doesnt help to kill a connection thats already in place, set the interface down and up with =ip link set wlp3s0 down=. If already on the installed system use =sudo=!

Alternatively use =nmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <passphrase>= (or =wifi-menu=) when the system is installed because Internet again is required to first obtain dotfiles and then packages.

With =nm-applet= connecting to wifis is relatively easy, however it is buggy with for example eduroam. A workaround is to click =connect to hidden wifi= and enter the ssid as well the rest manually.


** Window manager
The anarchy installer allowed me to install my window manager of choice - =bswpm= - already. It also installed =sxhkd= which is used as a hotkey daemon to setup keyboard shortcuts.



** Dotfiles
Now I'd need my dotfiles. But the most important thing first =sudo pacman -S git=. 
#+BEGIN_SRC  bash
git clone https://github.com/schoettkr/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles # might want to checkout a specific branch!
sudo pacman -S stow

cd dotfiles # you need to be in the dotfiles directory


stow -v -t ~/.config config # with '-t' the target dir can be set explicitly

mkdir ~/.fonts
stow -v -t ~/.fonts fonts

stow -v git

stow -v scripts

stow -v X

git clone https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh # if not already installed
stow -v zsh
#+END_SRC
You also want to setup github auth (to not be prompted by magit everytime for example). Do the following
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git config --global --add github.user <user>
git config --global --add github.oauth-token <token>
#+END_SRC


** Package manager
Setup home folder structure first or atleast have =~/arch/pkgs/= in place to then
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Also check sometimes that "yay" is still developed and the most common/best package manger :)
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git ~/arch/pkgs 
cd arch/pkgs/yay
makepkg -si
#+END_SRC


** Packages
*** Essential packages
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay -S polybar termite feh google-chrome redshift zsh-autosuggestions neovim rofi
#+END_SRC
*** Setup (neo)vim
However that should be done via current line in my config, but nevertheless:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
#+END_SRC
Then open nvim and run =:PlugInstall:=
*** Emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/schoettkr/Terra.git .emacs.d
yay -S emacs
#+END_SRC

*** Blogging
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay -S nikola texlive-core pygmentize
#+END_SRC

*** Password management
Use keepassxc https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc
#+BEGIN_SRC 
yay -S keepassxc
#+END_SRC

*** Reference managment
Use zotero (gtk2 application) because it has less dependencies than jabref and kbibtex
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay zotero
yay texlive-latexextra texlive-bibtexextra biber # for emacs org -> pdf export support
#+END_SRC
Open zotero and go to =Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Files and Folders= and change the data directory location to keep your home directory clean (change to eg =~/arch/pkgs=)
Then install the =zotero-better-bibtex= addon. Instructions can be found here https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/

*** Window compositor
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay -S compton
#+END_SRC

*** Video Player
Just install =mpv= no questions!!

*** Screenshots
To take screenshots =scrot= is a nice minimal utility. Install it and use it as follows:
- =scrot -u [filename]= to take screenshot of currently focused window
  - =scrot -u -d [num] [filename]= waits =num= seconds before taking the picture (defer)
- =scrot -s [filename]= and click or draw a rectangle to capture the selection
- other options:
 - =-b= also grabs the window's border
 - =-t= grabs a window and creates a thumbnail of it; This can be useful when you're posting screen captures online
 - =-c= creates a countdown in your terminal when you use the -d option
*** Document Viewer
#+BEGIN_SRC 
yay evince-light
#+END_SRC
*** Ebook Management
Update: Actually I don't like calibre and it does not seem to be worth it for me. Just put your pdfs/mobis/azws in library/books. Convert pdf documents with =k2pdfopt= and html files with https://ebook.online-convert.com/convert-to-mobi. That's it not much hassle. To put files onto your ebook reader just mount it and cp as you'd do for any other device - this is the method of least hassle.

Make sure to have the homefolder structure in place. Books are supposed to go into =~/library/books/Calibre=. Install =calibre= and set it up in accordance to this guide https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/3b7dzl/tutorial_how_to_use_calibre_to_manage_book/
Copy of the guide (as of 20.11.2018):
**** Le Guide
Setting up Calibre using Welcome Wizard:

Create a new empty folder using your library's desired name

Launch Calibre and choose that folder.

Next, Choose your device. If you choose Kindle, go to step 4. If you choose other e-readers, go to step 6. If you don't want to set up Send-to-Kindle, go to step 6.

Go to Amazon's Manage Your Content and Devices, choose Settings, find Personal Document Settings. Take note of the Send-to-Kindle E-Mail (ending with @Kindle,com). Find Add a new approved e-mail address and type in your GMX email.

In the Next dialog on Calibre welcome wizard, type in your Kindle email. Press Use GMX and type in your GMX credentials.

Next, and you are done.

.

Setting up your Calibre:

Select Preferences

Choose Behavior, set Preferred output format to AZW3 (if you're using Kindle) or EPUB (if you're using other devices). The reason is that AZW3 and EPUB can make use of Calibre's Edit Book function. Apply.

Choose Add your own columns, press the "+" button. Setup the following:

Pages (For Count Pages plugin, to get page number on your books):

Lookup name: pages

Column heading: Pages

Column type: Integers.

Format for numbers: {0,}

Shelf (To manage your reading progress):

Lookup name: shelf

Column heading: Shelf

Column type: Text, column shown in the tag browser.

Choose Common Options, Look & Feel, set Embed font famlly to your preferred font. I choose Bookerly here. Note: I have no problem using Bookerly on the Kindle 7th Gen, but for the older generations, there might be some issues. The font will be in the Publisher's Font option on the Kindle.

Choose Saving books to disk, Copy and paste the following to the Save template: 1. Books/{author_sort}/{title}/{title} - {authors}

Choose Sending books to devices, Copy and paste the following to the Save template: 1. Books/{author_sort}/{title}/{title} - {authors}

Choose Metadata plugboards, Add new plugboard

Format: any format

Device: any device

Source template: {series:|| - }{series_index:0>5.2f|[|] - }{title}

This will save your books like this: Harry Potter - [01.00] - Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone if your book is in a series, or Oliver Twist if your book isn't.

You can look here for more options

Destination field: title

Choose Plugins, find Kindle 2/3/4/Touch/PaperWhite/Voyage Device Interface, set:

Save templates: 1. Books/{author_sort}/{title}/{title} - {authors}

Custom column name to retrieve page counts from: #pages

Disable Overwrite existing apnx on device

Close, and restart Calibre

.

Adding plug-ins to power-up your Calibre:

Select Preferences, choose Plugins

Choose Get new plugins

Find and install Goodreads and Count Pages

Find Count Pages plugin, double click, under Page count options, choose Custom column: #pages. Leave the others blank.

Notes: This only gives you a rough estimation of the books. If you want a more accurate version, use Amazon books, or use the built-in Download page counts from Goodreads

Apply.

Go to Metadata download, and choose Goodreads

Apply, and Restart Calibre.

.

Using Calibre to manage books:

Add books: You can Drag-and-drop the ebook files to Calibre, or use the Add books function.

Edit metadata: You can type in your books' metadata manually, or download the data using Download metadata buttons. Calibre will automatically search book's data and you can choose the matching title.

Convert books: When sending to Kindle, Calibre'll automatically convert your books to Kindle readable formats, but it won't store the file locally. You can convert individually, or bulk convert to save the metadata directly to your books

If you connect Kindle to Calibre, Calibre will automatically find books on your Kindle. To send books to your Kindle, press Send to device.

Fetch news: You can choose your favorite news source from the menu, Press Schedule for download, choose days to download, and Save. Calibre will automatically download News IF IT IS RUNNING and send to your Kindle if you already set up Send-to-Kindle account.
*** Calculator
Install =speedcrunch=

*** IRC
Maybe get into =weechat= sometime but for now =hexchat= seems to be the sanest/simplest client :)

*** VPN (Uni etc)
Install =openconnect= and connect for example like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo openconnect https://vpn-server.uni-hannover.de/
#+END_SRC
And then enter credentials when prompted.

** Homefolder structure
Create the following folder structure in the home directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
~/arch
~/dls
~/dev
~/library

~/library/books

~/library/docs
;;~/library/docs/misc

~/library/music

~/library/images
~/library/images/wallpaper
~/library/images/personal

~/library/videos
~/library/videos/personal
~/library/videos/courses

~/misc

~/temp
;; ~/docs/coding
;; ~/docs/life
#+END_SRC

To get rid of the folders that are create by default edit (or via dotfiles) =~/.config/user-dirs.dirs= to the wanted structure and then remove them.
Then run =xdg-user-dirs-update=. (PS do not /remove/ =xdg_desktop_dir= <- read this on the internetz but check what really happens!).




** Programming
Stuff that is specific to programming / development
*** General
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay the_silver_searcher # this is ag
#+END_SRC
*** C/C++
Install the Clang compiler which is a compiler/frontend for C family languages based on LLVM:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay -S clang
#+END_SRC
Install cquery which is needed for emacs-cquery and lsp mode
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay -S cquery
#+END_SRC
Install gdb (GNU debugger that can be used for many languages_
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
yay gdb
#+END_SRC

** Tips & Tricks
*** Use more cores for compiling packages (mkkpkg)
In =/etc/makepkg.conf= change ~MAKEFLAGS="-jX"~ where =X= is the number of cores e.g =2=.

*** Sort/update pacman mirrors
*** Maintenance
*** Primer on zshell files
Since =.zshenv= is always sourced, it often contains exported variables that should be available to other programs. For example, $PATH, $EDITOR, and $PAGER are often set in .zshenv. Also, you can set $ZDOTDIR in .zshenv to specify an alternative location for the rest of your zsh configuration.

=.zshrc= is for interactive shell configuration. You set options for the interactive shell there with the setopt and unsetopt commands. You can also load shell modules, set your history options, change your prompt, set up zle and completion, et cetera. You also set any variables that are only used in the interactive shell (e.g. $LS_COLORS).

=.zlogin= is sourced on the start of a login shell. This file is often used to start X using startx. Some systems start X on boot, so this file is not always very useful.

=.zprofile= is basically the same as .zlogin except that it's sourced directly before .zshrc is sourced instead of directly after it. According to the zsh documentation, ".zprofile is meant as an alternative to `.zlogin' for ksh fans; the two are not intended to be used together, although this could certainly be done if desired."

=.zlogout= is sometimes used to clear and reset the terminal.
*** Ingoring aliases
To execute a command that is shadowed by an alias prefix it with an backslash, e.g `\vim`
*** Updating and upgrading
*** Configure touchpad
