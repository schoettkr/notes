# *this* & Object Prototypes
### Call-site
- `this` is a binding made for each function invocation, based entirely on how the function is called (its call-side) ==> inspect the call-site to answer what `this` is referring to
- to find out where a function is called from inspect the **call-stack** (the stack of functions that have been called to get to the current moment in execution)
  - the relevant call-site is *in* the invocation *before* the currently executing function
```js
function baz() {
    // call-stack is: `baz`
    // so, our call-site is in the global scope
    console.log( "baz" );
    bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
}

function bar() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
    // so, our call-site is in `baz`
    console.log( "bar" );
    foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
}

function foo() {
    // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
    // so, our call-site is in `bar`
    console.log( "foo" );
}

baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`
```
  - find the actual call-site from the call-stack to find out what `this` is referring to
  - visualize the call-stack by looking at the chains of function calls in order (use developer tools to avoid mistakes)
- rules of how the call-site determines where `this` points during execution of a function

### Default Binding
- most common case of function calls ==> standalone function invocation 
  - default catch-all rule when no other rules apply
```js
function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
}

var a = 2;

foo(); // 2
```
- **Note** the global variable `var a = 2` *is* synonymous with global-object properties of the same name (e.g window.a)
- `this` resolves to the global variable `a`because the *default binding* applies so `this` points at the global object 
- `foo()` is called with plain, undecorated function reference so none of the other rules apply
- **Note** if the contents of `foo()` are running in strict mode (the call-site is irrelevant) the global object is not eligible for *default binding* so `this` is set to `undefined` 

### Implicit(indirect) Binding
- does the call-site have a context object?
```js
function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
    a: 2,
    foo: foo
};

obj.foo(); // 2
```
- because `obj` is the `this` for the `foo()` call, `this.a` is synonymous with `obj.a`
- **Note** regardless of whether `foo()` is initially declared *on* `obj` or is added as a reference later (see above) the **function** is never really "owned" or "contained" by the `obj` object
- however, the call-site *uses* the `obj` context to **reference** the function (the object owns/contains the **function reference**at the time the function is called)
- when there is a context object preceeding a function reference the *implicit binding* rule says that it is *that* object which should be used for the functions `this`
- **Implicitly Lost**
  - confusion might occur when an *implicitly bound* function loses that binding and falls back to the *default binding* (global object or undefined in strict mode)
  ```js
  function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
      a: 2,
      foo: foo
  };

  var bar = obj.foo; // function reference/alias!

  var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

  bar(); // "oops, global"
  ```
  - `bar` is just another reference to `foo` and not to `obj.foo` and the call-site of `bar()` is plain/undecorated and thus default binding applies
  - the same happens when passing a callback function:
  ```js
  function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
  }

  function doFoo(fn) {
      // `fn` is just another reference to `foo`

      fn(); // <-- call-site!
  }

  var obj = {
      a: 2,
      foo: foo
  };

  var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

  doFoo( obj.foo ); // "oops, global"
  ```
- **Note** some JS libraries force a callback to have a `this` which points for example at the DOM Element that triggered the event
  - this can be useful sometimes and sometimes troublesome
  - when `this` is changed unexpectedly the control of how a callback function reference will be executed is lost (see [fixing this]())

### Explicit Binding
- trough their prototype, JS functions have access to `call(...)` and `apply(...)`
  - they both take, as their first parameter, an object to use for `this` and then invoke the function with that `this` specified
  - because of directly stating `this` , this is called *explicit binding*
  - they are identical but behave differently with the way the take their additional parameters
```js
function foo() {
  console.log( this.a );
}

var obj = {
    a: 2
};

// invoking foo with explicitly binding 'this' to be 'obj'
foo.call( obj ); // 2 
```
- this still does not prevent a function of "losing" its intended `this` binding when it just points at a function reference of an object 
- **Solution** ==> Hard Binding
  ```js
  function foo() {
    console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
      a: 2
  };

  var bar = function() {
      foo.call( obj );
  };

  bar(); // 2
  setTimeout( bar, 100 ); // 2

  // `bar` hard binds `foo`'s `this` to `obj`
  // so that it cannot be overriden
  bar.call( window ); // 2
  ```
  - `bar()` manually calls `foo.call(obj)` thereby forces invoking `foo` with `obj` as `this`
  - this is both *explicit* and *strong* so it is called *hard binding*
- since *hard binding* is so common, ES5 introduced the built-in utility `bind`
  ```js
  function foo(something) {
      console.log( this.a, something );
      return this.a + something;
  }

  var obj = {
      a: 2
  };

  var bar = foo.bind( obj );

  var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
  console.log( b ); // 5
  ```
  - `bind(...)` returns a new function that is hard-coded to call the original function with the `this` context as specified
  - **Note** bind has a .name property that derives from the original target function (which is the function call name that should show up in a stack trace)
- many libraries and many new built in functions provide an optional parameter called "context" or "thisArg" to specify a particular `this`

### `new` Binding
- in JS constructors are **just functions** that happen to be called with the `new` operator in front of them
  - they are not attached to classes, nor do they instantiate a class
  - they are no special types of functions
  - they are regular functions that are "hijacked" by the use of `new` in their invocation
- calling a function with `new` in front of it, makes that function call a *constructor call*
  - there's no such things as constructor functions, but rather construction calls *of* functions
- invoking a function with `new` in front of it (constructor call) the following happens
  1. brand new object is created(constructed)
  2. newly created object is Prototype-linked
  3. newly created object is set as the `this` binding for that function call (*new binding*)
  4. unless the function returns its own alternate object, the `new`-invoked function call will automatically return the newly created object

### Precedence
- *new binding* is more precedent than *implicit binding*
  - a hard bound call is able to be overridden with *new*
  - if the function is called with `new`, `this` is that newly created object
- *explicit binding* takes precedence over *implicit binding*
  - if the function is called with `call` or `apply` or even hidden inside a `bind` hard binding `this` is the explicitly specified object
  - if the function is called with a context (implicit binding) `this` is *that* context object
- *default binding* has the lowest priority
  - in strict mode the default `this` will be `undefined` and the `global` object otherwise

### Misc
- if `null` or `undefined` is passed as a binding parameter to `call`, `apply` and `bind` those values are ignored and instead the *default binding* rule applies
  - if a function doesnt care about `this` `null` might be a reasonable placeholder
  - or use a completely empty object(DMZ) for this case to prevent side effects
- it's quite common to use `apply(...)` for using an array of values as parameters
  - ES6 has the `...` spread operator to avoid a `this` binding if it's unnecessary => `foo(...[1,2])`
- `bind(...)` can curry parameters (pre-set values)
- arrow functions don't follow the rules above but adopt the `this` from it's enclosing function call (similar to `self = this`)
- [Softening Binding](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md#softening-binding)


## Objects
- two forms: 
  1. declarative (literal) form:
  ```js
  var myObject = {
    key: value,
    key2: value2
    // ...
  }
  ```
  2. constructed form (uncommon):
  ```js
  var myObject = new Object();
  myObject.key = value;
  myObject.key2 = value2;
  ```
  These result in the same sort of object, the only difference is that the literal can take multiple key/value pairs at once
- six primary/primitive types (not *object* types): string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object
  - the first 5 are not themselves objects
- "everything in JavaScript is an object" **is not true**

### Built-in Objects (object sub-types)
- String, Number, Boolean, Object, Function, Array, Date, RegExp, Error
- these are actually just built-in functions
  - therefore can be used as a constructor (with `new`), which results in a newly *constructed* object of the specified sub-type
  ```js
  var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
  typeof strPrimitive;                            // "string"
  strPrimitive instanceof String;                 // false

  var strObject = new String( "I am a string" );  // object created by "String" constructor
  typeof strObject;                               // "object"
  strObject instanceof String;                    // true
  ```
  - `strPrimitive` is  not an object, it is a primitive literal and immutable
    - to perform operations on it (e.g check length) a `String` object is required
    - to allow this JS automatically coerces a "string" primitive to a `String` object when necessary
      - same thing would happen between a literal primitive `42` and a `new Number(42)` object wrapper, when using a method like `12.453.toFixed(2)`
      - likewise for `Boolean` objects from `"boolean"` primitives
- `null` and `undefined` have no object wrapper form, only their primitive values
- `Date` values can *only* be created with the constructing object form (no literal counterpart)
- `Error` objects are rarely created explicitly (usually created automatically when exceptions are thrown)
- Arrays
  - the "." operator requires an `Identifier` compatible property name whereas "[]" can take any UTF-8/unicode compatible strings as the name for the property
    - that is why arrays use `[ ]` access since their properties are positive integers
  - in objects, property names are always strings any other value besides a `string`(primitive) will first be converted to a string, including numbers which are used as array indexes
  - arrays are objects so it is possible to add properties (does not change the result of arr.length)
    - a string containing a number as a property will end up being added to the array (arr.length will increase)
- Duplicating Objects
  - if an object is JSON-safe it can be duplicated by serializing it to a JSON string and then re-parsing it to an Object
  ```js
  var newObj = JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( someObj ) );
  ```
  - a shallow (not deep) copy is achieved by using ES6's `Object.assign(..)` which takes a *target* object as first parameter and one or more *source* objects as subsequent parameters
    - it iterates over all enumerable, owned keys (immdediately present) on the `source` objects and copies them via `=` assignment to the target

### Property Descriptors
- properties are descriped in terms of a **property descriptor**
  ```js
  var myObject = {
    a: 2
  };

  Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( myObject, "a" );
  // {
  //    value: 2,
  //    writable: true,
  //    enumerable: true,
  //    configurable: true
  // }
  ```
  - this includes much more than just its `value` of `2`
- with `Object.defineProperty(..)` new properties can be added, or existing ones modified
  ```js
  var myObject = {};
  Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
      value: 2,
      writable: true,
      enumerable: true,
      configurable: true
  } );
  ```

####Writable
- `true` if it's possible to change the property's value, `false` otherwise

####Configurable
- `true` if it's possible to modify the other property descriptor definitions
- `false` also prevents to use `delete myObject.myProperty` to remove an existing property
- **Note** even if `configurable` is `false` `writable` can always be changed from `true` to `false` but not back (TypeError)

####Enumerable
-  controls if a property will show up in certain object-property enumerations/interations (e.g `for .. in`)
- set to false to prevent showing up in such enumerations even though it's still completely accessible, set to true to keep it present
- normal user-defined properties are defaulted to `enumerable`(true)
- check with `myObject.propertyIsEnumerable("propName")` (checks only *directly* on the object)
- `Object.keys` returns all *enumerable* properties, whereas `Object.getOwnPropertynames(myObject)` returns an array of `all` properties (both inspect only the direct object)


### Immutability (Unveraenderlichkeit)
- immutable means that an object or properties cannot be changed (either by accident or intentional)
- they are differently nuanced ways to achieve this since ES5 but all of them create shallow immutability
  - if an object has a reference to another object (array, object, function, etc) the *contents* of that object can still be changed(remain mutable) unless that object is made immutable aswell

#### Object Constant
- combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false` to create a *constant* (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted) as an object property

#### Prevent Extensions
- `Object.preventExtensions( myObject )` prevents an object from having new properties added to it, but leaves the of the object's properties alone

#### Seal 
- `Object.seal( myObject )` creates a "sealed" object which prevents adding, reconfiguring and deleting any properties
  - esseantially calls `Object.preventExtensions( myObject )`  on the object **and** marks all existing properties as `configurable: false`
  - it is still possible to modify a property's value

#### Freeze
- `Object.freeze( myObject )` essentially *seals* an object but also marks all "data accessor" properties as `writable: false` so that the values cannot be modified
  - highest level of immutability

### `[[Get]]` and `[[Put]]`
- property access actually performs a `[[Get]]` operation 
  - if it cannot come up with a value for the requested value it returns `undefined`
    - inspecting only these results you cannot distinguish whether a property exists and just holds the value `undefined` or it does not exist and thus `undefined` is returned
    - **Solution:** the `in` operator checks to see if a property is present in an objector at any higher level of the prototype-chain
      ```js 
      ("presentProp" in myObject); // true
      ("nonpresentProp" in myObject); // false
      ```
      - `hasOwnProperty(...) does the same *without* consulting the prototype-chain
    - **Note** referencing **variables** that cannot be found the result is a `ReferenceError` 
- `[[Put]]` behaves differently based on a number factors, including whether the property is already present

### Getters & Setters
- ES5 introduced a way to override the default ([Get] and [Put]) operations, not on an object level but a per-property level
- getters are properties which call a hidden function to retrieve a value
- setters are properties which call a hidden function to set a value
- defining a property with a getter or setter (or both) it's definition becomes an "accessor descriptor" (opposed to a "data descriptor")
  - for accessor-descriptors `value` and `writable` characteristics of the descriptor are ignored and instead the `set` and `get` characteristics of the property (and `configurable` and `enumerable`) are considered

## Class Theory & Object Oriented Design

###*Not* JS specific
- stresses that data has assocciated behavior (different depending on type & nature of the data) that operates on it 
  - so proper design is to package (encapsulate) the data and the behavior together ==> "data structures"
  - Example: the characters of a string are the data and the behaviors that can be applied to that string (calculate length, searching, append something) are  all designed as methods of a `String` class
    - any string is just an instance of this class, whhich means that it's a neatly collected package of both, the data and the functionality
- an example for **classifying** a certain data structure is the relation between a `Car` and a `Vehicle` class where the former inherits from the latter (ability to carry people, engine, ..)
- another key concept is **polymorphism** which means that a general behavior from a parent class can be overriden in a child class to make it more specific
  - class theory suggests that a parent and a child class share the same method name for a certain behavior so that the child overrides the parent
- a child class is not linked to its parent class, instead it gets a copy of what it needs from the parent class ==> **Class inheritance implies copies**

###JS "Classes"
- JavaScript actually does **not** have classes (eventhough there is class-like syntax)
- since classes are design patterns it is possible to implement approximations for classical class functionality tho
- JS does not provide a native mechanism for "multiple inheritance"

###Mixins
- the name 'mixin' comes from an alternate way of explaining the task 
  - for example> `Car` has `Vehicle`s contents **mixed-in** 
- JS's object mechanism does not *automatically* perform copy behavior when you "inherit" or "instantiate" because there are no classes, only objects
  - objects don't get copied to other objects, they instead get *linked together*
- JS developers fake the missing copy behavior of classes with mixins (explicit and implicit)
  - dealing with objects (not classes)

####Explicit Mixins
- utility that manually copies behavior from one class (parent) to another (child) (often called `extend(...)`)
  ```js
  // vastly simplified `mixin(..)` example:
  function mixin( sourceObj, targetObj ) {
    for (var key in sourceObj) {
        // only copy if not already present
        if (!(key in targetObj)) {
            targetObj[key] = sourceObj[key];
        }
    }

    return targetObj;
  }

  var Vehicle = {
      engines: 1,

      ignition: function() {
          console.log( "Turning on my engine." );
      },

      drive: function() {
          this.ignition();
          console.log( "Steering and moving forward!" );
      }
  };

  var Car = mixin( Vehicle, {
      wheels: 4,

      drive: function() {
          Vehicle.drive.call( this );
          console.log( "Rolling on all " + this.wheels + " wheels!" );
      }
  } );
  ```
  - `Car` now has a copy of the properties and functions from `Vehicle`
  - technically functions are not copied but rather *references* to the functions are copied
  - because both objects have a property(function) `drive` the `this` binding for that function would be the `Vehicle` object instead of the `Car` object so `.call( this )` is used to ensure `drive()` is executed in the context of the `Car` object
  - **Note:** If the function name identifier for Car.drive() hadn't overlapped with (aka, "shadowed"; see Chapter 5) Vehicle.drive(), we wouldn't have been exercising "method polymorphism". So, a reference to Vehicle.drive() would have been copied over by the mixin(..) call, and we could have accessed directly with this.drive(). The chosen identifier overlap shadowing is why we have to use the more complex *explicit pseudo-polymorphism* approach
    - this creates brittle(bruechige) linkage(verknuepfungen) and while *explicit pseudo-polymorphism* can emualte "multiple inheritance" it increases complexity und thus should be avoided wherever possible
- explicit mixins are a fine mechanism in JS but appear more powerful than they really are
- (Parasitic Inheritance)[https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch4.md#parasitic-inheritance]

####Implicit Mixins
- closely related to *explicit pseudo-polymorphism* (same caveats)
- More[https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch4.md#implicit-mixins]

##Prototypes
- Objects in JS have an internal property called `Prototype` which is simply a reference to another object
- if a property is referenced and not directly present on an object the `Get` operations proceeds to follow the `Prototype` **link** of the object
  - this proceeds until either a matching property is found or the prototypal chain ends and `undefined` is returned
  - `for..in` also iterates over properties that can be reached over the prototypal chain (if enumerable)
  - `in` operator checks also for the entire chain (regardless of enumerability)
- the top-end of every *normal* prototype chain is the built-in `Object.prototype` (all normal/built-in objects descend from that object)
  - this object includes a variety of common utilities

###Setting & Shadowing Properties
```js
myObject.foo = "bar";
```
- if `foo` is directly present on `myObject` this assignment changes the value of the existing property
  - if it exists somewhere higher too, the `foo` property directly on `myObject` *shadows* any `foo` from a higher level
- if `foo` is not found anywhere it is added directly to `myObject`
- if `foo` is not directly present the `Prototype` chain is traversed (just like a `Get` operation)
  1. if `foo` is found anywhere higher and is not marked as readonly (writable) then a new property is added directly to `myObject` ==> shadowed property
  2. if `foo` is found anywhere higher and is read-only(not writable), then the setting of that existing property as well as the creation of the shadowed property on myObject **are disallowed** ==> no shadowing occurs
  3. if `foo` is found anywhere higher and is a setter then the setter will always be called ==> no `foo` will be added/shadowed to myObject, nor will the `foo` setter be redefined
  - to shadow in the cases 2 & 3 use `Object.defineProperty(..)`

###"Class" Functions
- in JS there are no copy-actions performed and no instances of classes created
  - instead (multiple) objects can be created that `Prototype` *link* to a common object
    - these objects are not totally seperated but rather ***linked***
  - **we end up with two objects, linked to each other** ==> calling this *prototypal inheritance* is confusing because *inheritance* (implies copy operation) implies much more than this linkage, adding *prototypal* in front of that does not change the fact that the word "inheritance" does not fit the way JS operates in this case
    - instead JS creates links, where an object can essentially *delegate* property/function access to another object ==> thus **Delegation** is a much more accurate term for JS's object linking mechanism
```js
function Foo() {
    // ...
}

Foo.prototype; // { }
```
- the property `prototype` points at an otherwise arbitrary object ("object arbitrarily labeled 'Foo dot prototype'")
  - each object created from `new Foo()` will be prototype-linked to this object (the object that `Foo.prototype` is pointing at)
  ```js
  var a = new Foo();
  Object.getPrototypeOf( a ) === Foo.prototype; // true
  ```

  - `new Foo()` has almost nothing *direct* to do with the process of creating this link ==> more of an accidental side-effect
    - more **direct** way: `Object.create(..)` 

###"Constructors"
- what lead to think `Foo` is a "class"?
  - `new` keyword (constructs class instances in class-oriented languages)
  - it appears that a *constructor* method of a class (because `Foo()` is actually a method that gets called) is executed  
  - capital 'F'oo even though this doesn't mean anything at all to the JS engine
  - another confusion:
  ```js
  Foo.prototype.constructor === Foo; // true
  var a = new Foo();
  a.constructor === Foo; // true
  ```
    - `a` directly **does not have a**  `.constructor` property on it so it resolves to the `Foo` function 
    - "constructor" **does not actually mean** "was constructed by"
- putting `new` in front of a normal function call makes that function call a "constructor call"
  - `new` hijacks any normal function and calls it in a fasion that constructs an object, **in addition to whatever else it was going to do**
  ```js
  function NothingSpecial() {
    console.log( "Don't mind me!" );
  }

  var a = new NothingSpecial();
  // "Don't mind me!"

  a; // {}
  ```
  - `NothingSpecial` is just a plain old normal function, but when called with new, it constructs an object, almost as a side-effect, which we happen to assign to a
  - the call was a constructor call, but NothingSpecial is not, in and of itself, a constructor

###Prototypes
- the Prototype mechanism is an internal link that exists on one object which references some other object
  - this linkage is (primarily) exercised when a property/method reference is made against the first object, and no such property/method exists
  - in that case, the Prototype linkage tells the engine to look for the property/method on the linked-to object
  - in turn, if that object cannot fulfill the look-up, its Prototype is followed, and so on 
    - this series of links between objects forms what is called the "prototype chain"
- ways to link `Bar.prototype` to `Foo.prototype`
```js
// pre-ES6
// throws away default existing `Bar.prototype`
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

// ES6+
/ modifies existing `Bar.prototype`
Object.setPrototypeOf( Bar.prototype, Foo.prototype );
```
- inspect relationship between two object
```js
// Simply: does `b` appear anywhere in
// `c`s [[Prototype]] chain?
b.isPrototypeOf( c );
```
- retrieve prototype of an object
```js
Object.getPrototypeOf( a );
```

###`create( .. `ing Links
- `Object.create( .. )` creates a new object linked to the object specified as first argument
  - to use all of the prototype power 
  - without any of the unnecessary complication of `new` functions acting as classes and constructor calls, confusing `.prototype` and `.constructor` reference or any of that
  - `Object.create(null)` creates an object that has an empty Prototype Linkage and thus can't delegate anywhere
    - typically used purely for storing data without side effects
```js
var anotherObject = {
    a: 2
};

var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject, {
    b: {
        enumerable: false,
        writable: true,
        configurable: false,
        value: 3
    },
    c: {
        enumerable: true,
        writable: false,
        configurable: false,
        value: 4
    }
} );

myObject.hasOwnProperty( "a" ); // false
myObject.hasOwnProperty( "b" ); // true
myObject.hasOwnProperty( "c" ); // true

myObject.a; // 2
myObject.b; // 3
myObject.c; // 4
```
- second argument to `Object.create( .. )` specifies property names to add to the newly created object, via declaring each new property's *propery descriptor*

##Behavior Delegation
- comparison between the classical ("prototypal") Object-Oriented (OO) pattern and the delegation-oriented OLOO (objects-linked-to-other-objects) pattern
- OO Style
```js
function Foo(who) {
    this.me = who;
}
Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
    return "I am " + this.me;
};

function Bar(who) {
    Foo.call( this, who );
}
Bar.prototype = Object.create( Foo.prototype );

Bar.prototype.speak = function() {
    alert( "Hello, " + this.identify() + "." );
};

var b1 = new Bar( "b1" );
var b2 = new Bar( "b2" );

// b1 and b2 delegate to Bar.prototype which delegates to Foo.prototype

b1.speak();
b2.speak();
```

- exact same functionality using *OLOO* style
```js
var Foo = {
    init: function(who) {
        this.me = who;
    },
    identify: function() {
        return "I am " + this.me;
    }
};

var Bar = Object.create( Foo );

Bar.speak = function() {
    alert( "Hello, " + this.identify() + "." );
};

var b1 = Object.create( Bar );
b1.init( "b1" );
var b2 = Object.create( Bar );
b2.init( "b2" );

b1.speak();
b2.speak();
```
  - delegation is the same as in the previous example
  - but it is greatly simplified because this are just **objects** linked to each other
    - without all the stuff that looks (but does not behave) like classes, with constructors and prototypes and `new` calls
